# Sample test files to test the merge conflicts
# Merge Conflict Demonstration

## Overview
This repository is created to demonstrate the concept of a merge conflict in Git. A merge conflict occurs when two branches have made changes to the same line in a file or when a file has been deleted in one branch and modified in another. This README provides a real-life analogy and the steps to reproduce the conflict.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a scenario in a workplace where two employees, Alice and Bob, are working on the same document. 

- **Alice** is responsible for updating the companyâ€™s introduction on the first page of the document.
- **Bob** is also making changes to the same section but has a different version of the introduction.

When they try to combine their changes (merge), the system cannot decide which version to keep, resulting in a **merge conflict**. Both employees must come together to resolve the disagreement before finalizing the document.

## Steps to Demonstrate Merge Conflict

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Git and GitHub set up on your machine.

### 1. Initial Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```
2. **Switch back to the main branch**
   ```bash
